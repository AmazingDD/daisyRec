## Overview

<!-- ![daisyRec's structure](pics/structure.png) -->

DaisyRec is a Python toolkit dealing with rating prediction and item ranking issue.

The name DAISY (roughly :) ) stands for multi-**D**imension f**A**irly compAr**I**son for recommender **SY**stem.

To get all dependencies, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Before running, you need first run: 

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

to generate `.so` or `.pyd` file used for further import.

Make sure you have a **CUDA** enviroment to accelarate since these deep-learning models could be based on it. We will consistently update this repo.

DaisyRec handled ranking issue mainly and split recommendation problem into point-wise ones and pair-wise ones so that different loss function are constructed such as BPR, Top-1, Hinge and Cross Entropy. All algorithms already implemented are exhibited below:

use `main.py` to achieve KPI results calculated by certain algorithm above. For example, you can implement this program to implement BPR-MF:

    python main.py --problem_type=pair --algo_name=mf --loss_type=BPR --num_ng=2

**All experiments code executed in our paper are exhibited in `master` branch. Please check out to `master` branch. Code in `dev` branch is still under developing.**

## TODO list

- [x] user-level time-aware fold-out method
- [x] user-level/item-level/user-item-level N-core
- [x] distinguish N-filter and N-core preprocess method
- [ ] weight initialization interface
- [x] a more friendly tuner
- [ ] make sure Item2vec work as expected
